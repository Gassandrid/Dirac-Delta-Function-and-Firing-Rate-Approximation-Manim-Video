# Dirac Delta Function and Firing Rate Approximation Video

This is my first [manim](https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/) video, although I have used the library before for smaller projects.

This video is essentially a rundown of Chapter 1.2 of the textbook [Theoretical Neuroscience](https://boulderschool.yale.edu/sites/default/files/files/DayanAbbott.pdf), attemping to animate some of the concepts and explain the things that were only touched on in the book(Dirac Delta Function, etc). The book also didnt really explain _why_ we need the delta function to model neurons, which is what I want to fill in.

3Blue1Brown, the origional creator of Manim has a style of not only explaining a concept, but providing a _why_ element that leads the viewer to discover the concept themselves. I want to try to do this in my video, and I think it will be a good exercise for me to learn how to explain things better. Not only that, but I see Manim as a great data visualization tool, the way matplotlib is, and I want to use it to help me understand the concepts in the book better. I think that this video will be a good way to do that.

## Technical Details

I use the Izhikevich model of a neuron to simulate the firing rate of a neuron, not very familiar with it so this was a good exercise for me to learn how to use it.
